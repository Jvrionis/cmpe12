Who to Contact for Questions:
First, If it is a general question, use Piazza. There is bound to be someone else with the same question 
as you and your fellow students are quite good at answering questions.

If it is specific to you (i.e. grades or that nature) please contact The TA in charge of your section 
first. 
 
I am always available to help as well if needed.  Please prepend all email sent to me with [CMPE12] though 
to make sure I can see it.

Course Work – CMPE 12
Attendance is highly recommended for the lectures as the material rapidly builds upon each topic.  The lecture material 
will be available in the resources area usually before the class.

There will be semiweekly homework assignments which are graded.  The instructor feels strongly that you learn by doing, 
not be just by reading or listening. There will be a midterm exam and one comprehensive final exam.  There will also be 
Online Quizzes. No calculators are ever allowed for any exam or quiz, unless explicitly stated.

If you have any disability-related needs, be sure to contact the Disability Resource Center well in advance of any 
expected need.

Class Evaluation
The class grade is determined by the following criteria:  Labs (25%), Homework (15%), Quizzes (5%), Midterm Exam (25%),
 and the Final Exam (30%).  You MUST get at least 50% on the Labs, Midterm and Final to pass the class.

Late Policy

Each student has 3 “free” late days that they can use for any assignment in the class, at any time, without advanced
permission. Any time you wish to use these late days you must fill out the appropriate form with how much time you 
wish to use in 6 hour increments, this does not need to occur before you use them. When these late days are used up, 
late assignments will receive a zero. For this class there will be two sets of late days, one for the labs and one 
for the homework.

Lab Work – CMPE 12L
You must be enrolled in CMPE12L to remain in CMPE12. You must pass CMPE12 to pass CMPE12L.  You must pass CMPE12L 
to pass CMPE12.  You will receive the same grade in the lab as the class.  Attendance in lab section is not 
required but you must be checked offed in your lab section

The labs will start out with basic hardware design and then transition to programming.  We will be working with 
two assembly languages in this course based on two processors: a 16-bit RISC type processor, the LC-3, covered 
in the text book, and a neat 32-bit microcontroller called the Uno32 (Arduino compatible).  

There will be lab assignments throughout the quarter that will have you do logic design or write programs in one 
of the languages covered in class.  No collaboration is allowed on lab assignments unless explicitly permitted in 
the assignment write-up.  When permitted, collaboration must be acknowledged and may only be with current course 
staff or students currently enrolled in CE12L. Failure to give credit when collaboration is allowed is a form of 
academic dishonesty and can be grounds for failure of the course.  You are not allowed at any point to share 
actual code with another student, collaboration is the discussion of the topic and how to solve it at a high
level.
 
Academic Honesty
Academic honesty is a requirement for the course.  All material produced must be your own independent work; 
this includes homework/quizzes, exams, and lab assignments. 

What  is  cheating?  It  is  presenting  work  that  is  not  yours  as  your  own.  You  can and  are encouraged
to discuss and strategize  with your colleagues on the material and labs, but your work should be your own. Copying
is NEVER acceptable. On  the  labs, cheating  is  sharing  code unless explicitly  told  that  it  is  permitted.  
If  a  student  is caught cheating in either the class or the lab this will result in an immediate failure in the 
class and  the  lab.  It  will  be  reported  to  your  college  and  your  department. DO NOT  CHEAT;  it  is  
not worth it.
