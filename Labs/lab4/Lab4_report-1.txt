Chipher


Purpose: 
To get a better understanding of subroutines by encrypting and decrypting a string of characters

Procedure:
Prompt the user, asking: Would you like to (E)ncrypt, (D)ecrypt, or e(X)it?. The GREET string will be
run until 'X' is given as input. The Cipher was created using a 2x200, two-dimensional array which is
necessary to store one string as "normal text" and  the other as an encrypted version of said string.
After the user picks one of the three options, for two of the options the user must then give a Cipher
value within the range 1-25. That will be the basis for the encryption. Row major or Column major can 
be used. Storing a string in row 0, the encrypted (or decrypted) string will be stored in row 1, It 
will then need to be printed to screen. I have made sure that these characters have not !@#)$_%*__))(
been affected and if user enters a ! and decrypts a message with ! in it, it will remain !.  

If the character lies within [A-M] (capitol) or [a-m] (lowercase) then shift 13 spaces.
If the character lies within the range [N-Z] or [n-z] then shift by negative 13. This will continue
until every character has been shifted following the appropriate conditions. The shifted characters
and unshifted characters make it possible to "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" a string.

I had alot of problem organizing my program. I tried to organize all my strings at the bottom of my
program but keept getting errors when trying to follow the same organizational structure I had with 
my last program. I was also told that if there is more than 255 lines separating my function calls
to my .Stringz problems will start to arise. That is why my .STRINGZ are in the beginning of my program
